Participants with non-use will be identiﬁed as those who produce signiﬁcantly \<50% of the total W of bilateral coupled pedaling with their paretic limb but are capable of unilateral pedaling with the paretic limb at a workload equivalent to 50% of the total W of bilateral coupled pedaling.

Given that CUped depends on motor learning, people with cerebellar strokes may not beneﬁt. Basal ganglia strokes can cause tremor, which is not the target of CUped. However, individuals with predominantly internal capsule lesions that also affect the basal ganglia will be included.
* Dementia or other cognitive impairment that interferes with learning and/or the ability to consent.

If a person cannot fit into the mock scanner, it is unlikely that the person can fit into the real scanner.
24. Testing positive for illicit drugs and cannabis (this will be established using a drug test that will be administered in the Clinical EEG \& Neuroimaging laboratory at the Institute of Mental Health Research \[IMHR\]). Participants who are cannabis users will be invited to participate in the study so long as they can abstain from cannabis use for approximately 2weeks prior to the baseline session and approximately 2weeks before final assessment. Ideally, participants would also abstain from cannabis use during treatment, but, this will not be tested/enforced.

We will require documentation (i.e., statement from the treating psychiatrist) that a treatment trial has failed (either no response to maximum tolerable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks, or side effects at sub-maximal doses) as coded by a revised Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF). The study investigators will confirm each treatment via review of records from referring psychiatrists and/or pharmacy records.

Additionally, it is recognized that the probability that a patient who has failed four medications in the current episode will achieve a lasting response with ECT is about 18% (60% probability of an acute response and 30% of maintaining response for at least 24 weeks); patients who have refused ECT because they feel the chance of benefit does not outweigh the risks associated with ECT will be considered eligible.

   * Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T4 disease prior to chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study.
   * Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided diagnoses are synchronous - that is, within 3 months of one another - and at least one of the two breast carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither Her-2 positive or inflammatory.
   * No evidence of metastatic disease

   1.4 No history of invasive breast cancer in 5 years prior to study registration other than the current diagnosis (prior ductal breast carcinoma in situ \[DCIS\] at any time is acceptable).

   1.5 Patients must have had a bilateral mammogram within 12 months prior to registration, unless the initial surgery was a total mastectomy, in which case only a mammogram of the remaining breast is required. (Subjects with bilateral total mastectomies do not require imaging).

   1.6 Investigations, including chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) chest, bone scan (with radiographs of suspicious areas) and abdominal ultrasound or liver scan or CT abdomen have been performed between the first histologic diagnosis and the time of registration as detailed below.
   * Chest X-Ray, 2 view (or Chest CT, or positron emission tomography \[PET\]/CT) is mandatory
   * Bone scans (with x-rays of abnormal areas) are required only if alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alkaline Phosphatase is elevated or if there are signs or symptoms of metastatic disease
   * Abdominal imaging is required only if ALT, AST or Alkaline Phosphatase is elevated or if there are signs or symptoms of metastatic disease
2. Prior Treatment

   2.1 All adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery completed at least 21 days prior to registration.

   2.4 Patients may have breast reconstruction during protocol participation, but definitive breast cancer surgery must be completed at least 21 days prior to registration.

   Concomitant biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, and bisphosphonates are acceptable.

   2.5 Surgical margins must be clear of invasive carcinoma. If there is microscopic residual ductal in situ disease present at lumpectomy or total mastectomy margins, further excision is highly recommended. If further excision is not undertaken, the subject may still be entered on study, provided that in addition to breast or chest wall irradiation, a boost to the tumor bed is delivered. In situ lobular disease at the margin is acceptable.

   2.6 All subjects (both adjuvant and neoadjuvant) must have sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone is allowed in the following instances:
   * Sentinel lymph node biopsy is negative: pN0
   * Sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive for isolated tumor cells only:

   pN0 (i+)
   * Clinically node negative, T1-2 tumors with sentinel lymph node biopsy positive in \< 2 lymph nodes without matted nodes and undergoing breast conserving surgery and tangential whole breast irradiation, or undergoing mastectomy and chest wall irradiation.
   * For patients who had a positive node prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, sentinel node alone is allowed after neoadjuvant therapy if:

     * Sentinel node biopsy is negative after chemotherapy and either at least 2 sentinel nodes were removed or a clip was placed in the involved node prior to treatment.
     * =\< 2 lymph nodes are positive for cancer and the patient is participating in A011202
   * All women who undergo breast conserving therapy must receive concomitant radiotherapy. Radiation after mastectomy is to be administered according to prespecified institutional guidelines. Radiation must be completed at least 21 days prior to registration.
   * Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer as defined above must receive at least 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, alone or in combination with ovarian suppression. (NOTE: for patients with ER and PR staining in less than 5% of cells, hormonal therapy for at least 5 years is strongly recommended but not required). Hormonal therapy can be initiated prior to or during protocol therapy.
3. Participants must be women
4. Age ≥ 18 years
5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1
6. Comorbid Conditions

   6.1 No history of other malignancy within the past 4 years, except for malignancies with a \>95% likelihood of cure (e.g. non-melanoma skin cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, in situ cervical cancer). Patients cannot have metastatic breast or other cancer.

   6.2 No diabetes mellitus currently treated with insulin or sulfonylureas.

   6.3 No history of serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory bowel disease and chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet.

   6.4 No history of severe cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity.
